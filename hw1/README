COMP 15 HW 1 Cheshire ConCATenation - no strings attached
Author: Devan Venkataraman

B. PURPOSE

The purpose of this program is to create a character array list class
that supports a wide variety of functions that resembles the array list
built into c++. These functions are meant to support the client and
also report errors in their usage.

C. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In this assignment, I consulted TA's at office hours mainly to troubleshoot
valgrind errors, which ultimately I discovered to be related to a small
over-iteration issue in my print function. I also consulted my COMP 11
homework assignments as a reminder of class syntax and re-familiarize
myself with some general OOP principles. I consulted an online resource
to nail down the purpose of copy constructors vs. assignment operators
but this was ultimately explained in Monday's lecture.

D. FILES

CharArrayList.h - Interface of the CharArrayList Class

CharArrayList.cpp - Implementation of the CharArrayList Class. Includes
4 total constructors, destructor, assignment operation, and the rest of
the assignment-outlined functions that manipulate the CharArrayList.
Also includes 3 private member functions: resize, expand, and getChar.

testCharArrayList.cpp - Test code for the CharArrayList class. includes
tests for all public member functions. Those functions with exceptions
and / or possible edge cases are tested against appropriately and
described more in depth in the testing section below.

E. COMPILE / RUN

The program is compiled by including the CharArrayList.cpp file. The
testCharArrayList.cpp file may also be included if the user would like
to test any of the functions. The program takes no user input.

F. DATA STRUCTURES

The data structure is an array list, made to be modified during the
program, unlike a normal array. It has the advantage of having several
functions that can manipulate the list. It's disadvantages include
quitting upon an error in its usage and any limitations to its
functional abilities.

G. TESTING

The testing was broken into two groups as to limit the length of the
main function in the testCharArrayList.cpp file. The first group tests
both cases of the isEmpty function, first and last functions as used
normally and when triggering their runtime_error exceptions, elementAt
as used normally and its out_of_range exception, and both the pushAtBack
and pushAtFront functions.

The second function test group tests the insertAt function inserting
an element into the middle of the array, at the end, and triggering its
exception. It tests the insertInOrder function both with insertions
into the middle and end of the array as well. It tests popFromFront and
popFromBack with both normal cases and triggering their runtime_error
exceptions. It tests the removeAt and replaceAt functions both normally
and with their respective out_of_range exceptions. It tests concatenate
by concatenating a standard array to an empty array, an empty array to
a standard array, an array to itself, and a case where an expansion is
needed. Finally it tests shrink to shorten the array to the minimum
capacity necessary.
