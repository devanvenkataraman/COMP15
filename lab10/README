I'm doing this lab in order to avoid bad things that might happen if I don't do it.

Universal polymorphism prevents tons of code being rewritten. This is
helpful for this case because we would have two nearly identical classes
that are only differentiated by variable types. Through polymorphism,
we can implement the same class for different situations, such as with
integers and dogs.
