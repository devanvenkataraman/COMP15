Program Purpose: This lab assignment is to learn about Recursion. The point
of the program is to solve a generated maze by displaying the correct path.


Acknowledgements: I asked TA's a couple questions about my progress and
my base cases

Run command: Run executable with "./mazeSolver"

Files:

maze.cpp: Implementation of the maze class. Includes several solve
functions, not all are completed.

maze.h: Header file for maze class

Testing:
I tested the program with mazes of several different sizes. I was
unable to finish the count with length functions, but I was able
to have the TA show me his solution so that I understood its recursion.
