This lab contains a partial implementation of Graph BFS traversal.

README           : this file
search-campus.cpp:   main driver of the project.
                     Reads file and asks for source and destination
Graph.cpp        : graph class with extra helping tools to run BFS/DFS
Graph.h          : interface of graph class above
Stack.cpp        : simple template stack class used (for DFS)
Stack.h          : interface of Stack class above
NodeType.h       : interface of Nodetype class
                   (a simple struct used in the linked list class)
Queue.cpp        : simple template queue class used for BFS
Queue.h          : interface of Queue class above
Makefile         : information on how to compile the whole project
campus-map.txt   : description of the Tuft campus map and all adjacencies

In order to compile the program simply type 'make search' in the console
You can execute it with './search campus-map.txt'

The code is not complete: Students must implement some functions in
Graph.cpp.  However, the code will properly compile and run without
the missing procedures (it will not produce a segmentation fault)
